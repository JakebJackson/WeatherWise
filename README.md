# WeatherWise
A weather dashboard application.

## About this repository
This repository aims to create a weather dashboard application by utilising an external API to get real-time information about a user-specified area and display the returned information back to the user on the webpage.

## Technologies
Throughout this project I used a few APIs to simplify and expand upon my design scope, firstly I used [jQuery](https://jquery.com) for most of the JavaScript, I also used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for the CSS side of things and lastly the API I used to get the real-time weather data was [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).
